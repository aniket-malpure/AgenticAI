      "Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of India and explain it in detail. Hmm, I remember that India is a big country with a rich history. I think the capital is Delhi, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall more details.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard that Delhi is a very old city, maybe even ancient. It's in the north part of India, right? I think it's near the Yamuna River. Wait, wasn't there another city that used to be the capital before? Oh, right, I think it was Calcutta, but that was a long time ago when the British were ruling India. So after independence, they moved the capital to Delhi. That makes sense because Delhi has a lot of historical significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, about New Delhi. I remember that term being used a lot. Is New Delhi a part of Delhi? I think so. Maybe it's the area where the government buildings are. I've heard of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, which is the presidential palace, right? And there's the India Gate, which is a war memorial. So New Delhi is the administrative part, while Delhi is the larger city.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should check when New Delhi became the capital. I believe it was around the time of India's independence, so maybe 1947. But wait, I think the planning for New Delhi started before that, perhaps in the early 20th century when the British were still ruling. So maybe the construction began in 1911 and it was completed in 1931. That sounds familiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that New Delhi was designed by British architects, like Edwin Lutyens. He must have been a prominent figure in designing the city's layout. The city is known for its wide avenues and monumental buildings, which reflects a blend of British and Indian architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "What else is there? Oh, the Secretariat Building, which houses government offices. And the Parliament House, which is where the Indian legislature meets. These are all in New Delhi. Also, Connaught Place is a major business and commercial area there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the climate in Delhi is quite hot during summers and cold in winters. It's a landlocked city, so it doesn't have the moderating effect of the sea. That makes the summers really intense, maybe over 40 degrees Celsius sometimes. Winters can get pretty chilly, especially in December and January.\n",
      "\n",
      "Culturally, Delhi is a mix of old and new. There are historical sites like the Red Fort and Qutub Minar, which are from the Mughal and earlier periods. The food in Delhi is famous too, with popular dishes like butter chicken and various street foods. Chandni Chowk is a well-known market area in Old Delhi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transportation-wise, Delhi has a metro system that's pretty efficient. It's connected by rail and air to other parts of the country. The Indira Gandhi International Airport is one of the busiest in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also remember that Delhi has faced issues with air pollution, especially in recent years. The government has been trying to implement measures to reduce pollution levels, like the odd-even car rationing scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the capital of India is New Delhi, which is part of the larger Delhi region. It serves as the administrative and political center, with significant historical, cultural, and economic importance. The city was planned by the British, features a blend of architectural styles, and is home to many landmarks and institutions essential to India's governance and identity.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The capital of India is New Delhi, a city steeped in history and cultural richness. Located in the northern part of the country, it lies along the Yamuna River. New Delhi was declared the capital in 1911, with construction beginning in 1912 and completing in 1931. Designed by British architects like Edwin Lutyens, it features wide avenues and monumental buildings that blend British and Indian architectural styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the administrative center, New Delhi houses key government buildings such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan (presidential palace), the Secretariat, and the Parliament House. The city is also a hub for commerce, with areas like Connaught Place being major business centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Culturally, New Delhi is a mix of old and new, with historical sites like the Red Fort and Qutub Minar, and vibrant markets like Chandni Chowk. The city's cuisine is renowned, featuring dishes like butter chicken and diverse street foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delhi experiences a varied climate, with hot summers and cold winters. It is well-connected by air, rail, and road, with the Indira Gandhi International Airport being a major hub. However, the city faces environmental challenges, particularly air pollution, prompting initiatives like the odd-even traffic scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, New Delhi is not just the capital but a symbol of India's rich history, governance, and cultural diversity.\n"
